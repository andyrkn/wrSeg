								For making our work easier, we planned a meeting and start sketching a design using the blackboard. The user
								should be able to do any action with less than 3 clicks. This is the key for our SPA application. In the main
								window we can see two frames, in the left one we can see the added photo, in the right side we can see the
								procesed photo, under those two frames we can see the options for search the history of the images uploaded and
								procesed by the app. Underneath the options we have the preview of the history or shared images. On the right
								side we have a sidebar that gets open when pressing the left side buttons. The side bar contains the fields for
								login or the chat depending on the button pressed.

							<div class="section_subtitle">UI Prototype</div>
						</div>
						<div class="about_text">
							<p>
								First we started by creating an visual prototype for our application. For this
								we had to debate what we need to keep from the web-application and how to display
								web functionalities on a smaller screen and to be at the same time closer to the
								mobile environment. 
							</p>
							<p>
								We chose to make a multi page application with the following pages: <code>Upload</code> , 
								<code>Result</code> and <code>History</code>.
							</p>
						</div>

						<div class="section_title_container">
							<div class="section_subtitle">Upload page</div>
						</div>
							<p>
								For the <code>Upload</code> page we chose to make use of phone versatility and to use it's camera
								application to upload images with manuscripts or any other type of texts. Also on this 
								page, the user has the ability to improve the results by setting some parameters like:
								treshold, noise, use Gauss for normal users, and for advanced ones the advanced setting:
								maximum column separators, maximum number of separtors, minimum scale and the maximum
								number of lines, to improve the speed of our solution. Also, the user can upload the photo
								without setting any parameters, and the result will be calculated with the default ones.
							</p>
							<p>
								After the user upload it's manuscript and visualise it on a preview space on the upload page,
								and after he end setting the parameters (if he chose to), he can press the submit button from 
								down of the page and an loading pop-up will appear and will disappear after we got his results.
								When the loading pop-up disappear the <code>Result</code> button from the top-right corner of
								the page will be activated and the user can navigate to the <code>Result</code> page.
							</p>
						</div>

						<div class="section_title_container">
							<div class="section_subtitle">Result page</div>
						</div>
						<div class="about_text">
							<p>
								In the <code>Result page</code>  the user can visualise the results after processing the image
								provided by him in the <code>Upload page</code>. In the image, user can see how our algorithms
								recognised where the titles, columns, adnotation and other special paragraphs are placed in the 
								image, by being framed by rectangles of various colors that denote the type of paragraph.
							</p>
							<p>
								Also here we display the used parameters for the displayed result, so that the user to understand
								by comparison with later results that the parameters can provide him better results.
								On the top of the page the user can set a title for the result and after the title was typed, the 
								<code>Save</code> button form the top right corner of the page will be activated and will let user to save the 
								result and will send him to the <code>History page</code>.
							</p>
						</div>
						
						<div class="section_title_container">
							<div class="section_subtitle">History page</div>
						</div>
						<div class="about_text">
							<p>
								On this page we have a list of results, saved from the <code>Result page</code>
								with the photo of the manuscript in the left of the row and in the right side the 
								title chosen by the user at save time.
							</p>
							<p>
								At any time the user can tap over any of the saved results and review the result
								in the <code>Result page</code>. These saved results are saved localy on the device
								without using our service, so if the application is uninstalled all the saves will
								be lost. Also the user has the ability to delete any of the saved results by tapping 
								on the <code>Delete</code> button from the top-right corner of the page and select 
								which result have to be deleted and then to tap on <code>Done</code> when he end his 
								job.

						<div class="about_text">
							<p>
								To implement the iOS Mobile Application we used the MacOS platform, because it's the 
								most stable way to implement iOS applications. We made use of the Xcode IDE especially
								made for Apple Environment Development. We chose to implement the application in the
								<code>Swift</code> because it's the latest programming language to be used for iOS 
								development and because it's much more closer to the <code>Python</code> language learned
								this year at <code>FII</code>. 
							</p>
							<p>
								We started by learning the basics of the <code>Swift</code> programming language from 
								<code><a href="https://swift.org/documentation/">swift.org</a></code> and after we established 
								our basis, we started with an application tutorial provided by Apple ( <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/DevelopiOSAppsSwift/">Start Developing iOS Apps</a>)
								which was an Food Traker app that took as through all Apple concepts about creating an iOS app:
								building an UI and connecting it to our code (UI Prototype), working with view controllers 
								(Upload and Result pages), creating our data models (for class representation the results), 
								creating table views (History page), implementing navigations between pages and making 
								persistent data (saving data on the device).
							</p>
						</div>

							<div class="section_subtitle">Android Implementation</div>
						</div>
						<div class="about_text">
							<p>
								The implementation of Android Mobile App was made in WindowsOS. As an editor it
							   was used Android Studio IDE and written in Android Language(JAVA) and use AndroidSDK
							   environment.
								 The project use standard android library used for implementing UI interface and in activities
							   for retrieve the photo from the galery , save it and send it to the back-end for processing
							   and get it the procesed file back, for that we use library like okhttp3 and retrofit2 with helped us 
							   with Rest services.	 	 	 	
							</p>
							<p>
								  The app is separeted by two activities: The <code>Main Activity</code> which get the photo selected from the user
								and show it on the screen by pressing the  <code>Upload Image </code> button, the <code>SEND PHOTO</code> button 
								will send to the second activity <code>Text Activity</code>) the chosen photo.
								  <code>Text Activity</code> will show the seleced image from the first screen and option for controling parameters like
								<code>Thresold</code> or  <code>Noice</code>, for each one of them we used an FloatSeekBar for adjust the value.
								The upper two corners contain two buttons <code>History</code> for showing the last proccessed images and <code>Result</code>
								for  result of the proces.
								The <code>SUBMIT</code> will give the back-end server the photo and get the proccessed one.
