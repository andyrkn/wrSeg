To run script.py you'll need:
    1. Ocropy (look here: https://github.com/tmbdev/ocropy)
    2. Keras + Tensorflow (this will prob help: http://students.info.uaic.ro/~andrei.timcu/data/teaching/rn/week9/Keras.pdf)
    3. Pillow, OpenCV
    4. Several versions of Python. Ocropy needs 2, Tensorflow 3

The script works if you run:
    python2 script.py <arguments>
